- 👋 Hi, I’m @LeakTheDrunkPotato. I created this account specifically for ClanGen bug reports.
- 👀 I’m interested in animals and games of all kinds, such as MineCraft. I'm not too great at describing myself, as you might've already noticed.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning German.
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on nothing for the time being.
- 📫 How to reach me: DISCORD: leakthedrunkpotato || REDDIT: u/HopperrKing
